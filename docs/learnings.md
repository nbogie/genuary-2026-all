# learnings and issues

## day 1

-   just taking the ts template out for a drive.

## day 2

-   learning: lodash doesn't seem to tree-shake. es-toolkit better replacement with 6 million weekly downloads. (e.g. for minBy)
-   issue: vite bundling: calls to gsap.to external dep getting bundled as gsap.gsap
-   reflection: not enough time. this prompt wants a lot of time - 12 principles!
-   reflection: next time find a small ts-friendly state-machine rather than code it
-   reflection - it's obvious that there was no driving intentionality towards the look and feel of the final sketch (only that I wanted an agent to anticipate its movement, and squash and stretch). Their very random target destination picking gives lacklustre results, for example.
